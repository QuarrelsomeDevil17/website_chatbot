The document contains information about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in which neural networks are able to learn unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language.

Large language models (LLMs) are a type of neural network architecture that can perform various natural language processing tasks.
